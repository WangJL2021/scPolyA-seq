## scPolyA-pipe

The pipeline to get polyA site and single-cell polyA site matrix from raw fastq of scPolyA-seq.


**How to use scPolyA-pipe to do *de-novo* polyA site discovery and get APA matrix from scPolyA-seq?**


### 1. Download this pipeline and install required softwares.

Download this set of snakemake rules under scPolyA-pipe/ to anywhere on your Linux system, 
and install some required softwares.

```
Our tests based on the following envirenments:
OS: CentOS 7
$ python3 -V #Python 3.7.3
$ snakemake --version  #6.4.1
$ R --version  #R version 3.6.0 (2019-04-26) -- "Planting of a Tree"
$ STAR --version #STAR_2.5.2b
$ fastqc --version  #FastQC v0.11.8
$ multiqc --version #multiqc, version 1.7

$ samtools --version
samtools 1.9-69-gb217a91
Using htslib 1.9-149-gf5b75ff

$ bedtools bamtobed --version
Tool:    bedtools bamtobed (aka bamToBed)
Version: v2.25.0
```





### 2. Prepare raw fastq files.

Goto your working directory, put your fastq file

```
for C1 data in our assay, put your cellId_R2.fastq.gz in raw/, like
raw/c01ROW07.fastq.gz
raw/c01ROW12.fastq.gz

or fastq file in fq/, like
fq/c01ROW07.fq
fq/c01ROW12.fq
```




### 3. Set configuration file

Make a new text file named config.yaml under working directory, 
put important initial settings in it.


```
$ head config.yaml
Snk_RootDir: /home/wangjl/data/scPolyA-seq/scPolyA-pipe
star_index: /home/wangjl/data/ref/hg19/index/star/

RawPath: /home/wangjl/data/scPolyA-seq/data/raw_sc/human
test: /home/wangjl/data/apa/test/raw
Samples:
 - c01ROW07
 - c01ROW12
```



### 4. Run pipeline

We recommend open an Tmux panal, in case the pipeline ceased on network error.

Run this pipeline under working directory:

```
$ snakemake -s /home/wangjl/data/scPolyA-seq/scPolyA-pipe/main.sf -j 40 -p

Params: 
-s the absolute path of this snakemake main script.
-j CPU core number to use.
-p print the command used in every rule.
```

Wait until the workflow ends.







## Visulazation

The files under step1/ to step5/ are codes used for analyzing and visulization in this project.
